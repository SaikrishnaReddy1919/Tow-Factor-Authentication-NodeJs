Today, people are using the internet to connect with friends and family, manage their finances, invest, attend classes, and more. At the backbone of this are services that have traditionally required standard methods of authorization mostly a username and password.


As technology has become more advanced and complex the traditional methods of securing your personal information are no longer acceptable. This has led to the development of alternatives to help ensure the security of your data. One of these developments is two-factor authentication also known as 2FA. Two-factor authentication provides an additional layer of security on top of your standard authentication process. The two-factor authentication layer requires you to enter additional data to access your account. This data can come from different sources:


    > A physical possession e.g smartphone or access card
    > A biological attribute e.g biometrics such as fingerprints or retina

The most common forms of two-factor authentication involve entering a code sent to your mobile phone or entering a code retrieved from an authentication app.
